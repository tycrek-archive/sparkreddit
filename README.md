## Contributing

### Code

If you want to contribute code to the project, feel free to submit a pull request but I cannot guarantee that it will be approved as I want to get the core functionality cleaned up first (up to submit posts in the Roadmap). If you find a bug or want to clean up the code, those have a higher chance of being approved and I would highly appreciate it.

### Logo

If you are a graphic designer, I would love any ideas for a logo! I don't have anything specific in mind, but the app is "Spark for Reddit" so maybe that could inspire someone.
